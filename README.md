## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
### I'm Mathieu Timmerman, an IT student and here's my portfolio.
### You can find the latest projects I've worked on here, but first let's talk about my background.

#### I am French student. I studied at ENSICAEN (Caen, France) from 2021 to 2025 to learn more about IT, and I've had the chance to continue my studies at UQAC (QuÃ©bec, Canada) from 2023 to 2025, in order to learn more about video games and the video game industry. It was very rewarding, and I was able to work on various video game projects.

# TPS prototype - 2024

This project was developed on Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++), and I was in a team of 4 people. Our project was a prototype for a third-person shooter.
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, in which the player controls a woman who, from a hidden base in Antarctica, can control different characters to carry out different missions, such as destroying enemy property and freeing hostages.

So we set up the character's logic with basic movements (walking, running, crouching, climbing) and the use of firearms. We also have the logic of the AI, which can shoot, make rounds, take cover, etc. Finally, we've set up maps with the different objectives, as well as the main menu where you can see the main character's hidden base.

In this project, I was in charge of the AIs and I partly managed the logic of the weapons so that the AIs could use them.

This mainly enabled me to improve my skills on enemy AIs by using behaviour trees.

# AR Application for sign language - 2024

This project was developed on Unity, and I was part of a team of 5 people developing an application for learning sign language. The aim was to work with AR, so we turned our attention to sign language with hand recognition.

So first we worked on hand recognition to recognise and record different signs. Secondly, we had to set up a level system so that the user wouldn't get lost when using our application.

The biggest challenge of our project was the use of VR headsets, which only allow you to see the back of the hand, so you can't always recognise the sign. We were lucky enough to have a deaf person in our team, who was able to explain to us how sign language works, as well as the recordings we made.

I really liked how we could set the logic for the levels, trying to find the better solution for our application.

# Infiltration game - 2024

In this project called *Deadly workspace* and developed on Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++), I worked in a team of 3 on a first-person game in which the player has to leave his workplace after a day's work, unfortunately the only way out is to get the key from the boss's office on the top floor.

In this game, the player has to move from floor to floor, carrying out various tasks such as downloading files and making photocopies for the secretary, who is the only one who lets the player move to the next floor. The tricky part is not to get caught by the people who are still working; at night, these people attack anyone who isn't authorized to be here.

So, of course, in this game, the aim is to avoid being noticed, to hide when you make noise and to run only as a last resort.

This was the first time working on enemy AIs with behavior trees, which is very interesting. I also work on interactive objects such as the computer for the tasks, the coffee machine to give a bonus to the player, the elevator and the baits, which make sound to distract the enemies. I was also in charge of the team.

# Serious game - 2024

This project called FarmLife has been developed on Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++). I worked in a 4-person team on a serious game about permaculture, the aim is to learn more about the bases of the permaculture.

In this game, the player can plant seeds of different vegetables and fruits on different tiles. Each plant gives points, the player has to get the better score in each level, if they use permaculture principles, they will earn more points and access the next level.

We developed the logic of the plants and the different relations they can have with each other.

I mainly worked on the main menu and the pause menu. I also dealt with the save logic and the tutorial which is rather important for a serious game.

Here's the video of the demo (in French only):
