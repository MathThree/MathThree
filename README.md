## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
### I'm Mathieu Timmerman, an IT student and here's my portfolio.
### You can find the latest projects I've worked on here, but first let's talk about my background.

#### I am French student. I studied at ENSICAEN (Caen, France) from 2021 to 2025 to learn more about IT, and I've had the chance to continue my studies at UQAC (QuÃ©bec, Canada) from 2023 to 2025, in order to learn more about video games and the video game industry. It was very rewarding, and I was able to work on various video game projects.

# TPS prototype - 2024

This project was developed on Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++), and I was in a team of 4 people. Our project was a prototype for a third-person shooter.
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, in which the player controls a woman who, from a hidden base in Antarctica, can control different characters to carry out different missions, such as destroying enemy property and freeing hostages.

So we set up the character's logic with basic movements (walking, running, crouching, climbing) and the use of firearms. We also have the logic of the AI, which can shoot, make rounds, take cover, etc. Finally, we've set up maps with the different objectives, as well as the main menu where you can see the main character's hidden base.

In this project, I was in charge of the AIs and I partly managed the logic of the weapons so that the AIs could use them.

This mainly enabled me to improve my skills on enemy AIs by using behaviour trees.

*In the main menu, you can choose your character, weapon and outfit, all of which will affect your stats.*

*In-game, you can see your character's health, ammunition and current mission status.*

# AR Application for sign language - 2024

This project was developed on Unity, and I was part of a team of 5 people developing an application for learning sign language. The aim was to work with AR, so we turned our attention to sign language with hand recognition.

So first we worked on hand recognition to recognise and record different signs. Secondly, we had to set up a level system so that the user wouldn't get lost when using our application.

The biggest challenge of our project was the use of VR headsets, which only allow you to see the back of the hand, so you can't always recognise the sign. We were lucky enough to have a deaf person in our team, who was able to explain to us how sign language works, as well as the recordings we made.

*Example of a level in which no sign is required, just an explanation at the start of use of the application (in French).*

*Example of a level in which the user must sign the letter A (LSF).*
