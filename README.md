## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
### I'm Mathieu Timmerman, an IT student and here's my portfolio.
### You can find the latest projects I've worked on here, but first let's talk about my background.

#### I am French student. I studied at ENSICAEN (Caen, France) from 2021 to 2025 to learn more about IT, and I've had the chance to continue my studies at UQAC (QuÃ©bec, Canada) from 2023 to 2025, in order to learn more about video games and the video game industry. It was very rewarding, and I was able to work on various video game projects.

##### If you want to contact me, you can send me an e-mail (*timmer[dot]mathieu[at]gmail[dot]com*)

## My projects
- [TPS Prototype - 2024]
